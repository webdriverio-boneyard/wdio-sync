*This is a modified version of the wdio-sync with an enhanced stack trace functionality. All of the rights belong to the wdio team.

A WebdriverIO plugin. Helper module to run WebdriverIO commands synchronously. It overwrites global functions depending on the test framework (e.g. for Mocha `describe` and `it`) and uses Fibers to make commands of WebdriverIO using the wdio testrunner synchronous. This package is consumed by all wdio framework adapters.

# Development

Watch changes:

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

Run tests:

```sh
$ npm test

# run test with coverage report:
$ npm run test:cover
```

```

# Contributing

Make sure all changes you apply are passing unit tests as well as all integration tests of the depending wdio framework adapters.
